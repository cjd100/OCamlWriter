HTML help

HTML help:

When writing in HTML, use the standard tags. By clicking on the format HTML 
button in the HTML dropdown menu, the tags will be organized into a more
readable format. By clicking on the write HTML button, a .html file in your
directory will be created that can be interpreted.

Shortcuts have been provided for italics and bold

  Use * to denote bold text (Ex: *hello*)

  Use _ to denote italics (Ex: _hello_)

By clicking format HTML, these shortcuts will be automatically converted to the
tags <b> and <i> respectively. One can also write HTML without formatting first,
and the shortcuts will be converted accordingly, but not modified in the actual
text file.
