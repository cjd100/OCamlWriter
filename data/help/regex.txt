Regular Expression Help

Regular Expressions:

The Find and Replace functionality under the Edit menu both allow the option to 
search/replace by regular expressions.

Below is a guide of regular expression features that can be used:

.      Matches any character except newline.

*      (postfix) Matches the preceding expression zero, one or several times

+      (postfix) Matches the preceding expression one or several times

?      (postfix) Matches the preceding expression once or not at all

[..]   Character set. Ranges are denoted with -, as in [a-z]. An initial ^, as in
       [^0-9], complements the set. To include a ] character in a set, make it the first character of the set.
       To include a - character in a set, make it the first or the last character of the set.

^      Matches at beginning of line: either at the beginning of the matched string, or just after a '\n' character.

$      Matches at end of line: either at the end of the matched string, or just before a '\n' character.

\|     (infix) Alternative between two expressions.

\(..\) Grouping and naming of the enclosed expression.

\1     The text matched by the first \(...\) expression (\2 for the second expression, and so on up to \9).

\b     Matches word boundaries.

\      Quotes special characters. The special characters are $^\.*+?[].

<A>{B} Matches the text matched by A, repeated exactly B times.
